This module contains a few functions used to sort out the events resulting
from a photo-electric ionization, or from a Compton scattering, and also a
function used to determine more precisely than with pixels of a 16x16 image the
position of the maximum in a given image.

    the image, it puts 0 where we don't have any data. We also return
